{"id":"probeHTTP-3qo","title":"Align response storage format with HTTPx raw HTTP format","description":"probeHTTP's response storage diverges from HTTPx in 6 areas: directory layout (extra response/ subdir), no index.txt, hash includes method prefix, custom === SECTION === format instead of raw HTTP, redirect chain is summarized instead of full req/resp pairs, and final URL is in a section instead of bare last line. All 6 must match HTTPx so downstream tools consume either tool's output interchangeably.","status":"in_progress","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"stefan.kraxberger@secinto.com","created_at":"2026-02-08T16:19:00.195058+01:00","created_by":"Stefan Kraxberger","updated_at":"2026-02-08T16:19:18.837216+01:00"}
