All 6 must match HTTPx so downstream tools consume either tool's output interchangeably.","status":"in_progress","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"stefan.kraxberger@secinto.com","created_at":"2026-02-08T16:19:00.195058+01:00","created_by":"Stefan Kraxberger","updated_at":"2026-02-08T16:19:18.837216+01:00"}
